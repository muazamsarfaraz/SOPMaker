**Structure of a Saved SOP (inside the downloaded ZIP, and expected for loading):**

When an SOP is saved, a ZIP file (e.g., `My_SOP_Title.zip`) is created. Upon extraction, it yields a folder named after the SOP title (e.g., `My_SOP_Title/`), containing:

```
My_SOP_Title/ (or chosen SOP title)
├── diagram.bpmn         # BPMN diagram with process-specific business logic
├── description.md       # Contextual description tailored to process type
├── procedure_steps.md   # Actionable procedure steps
├── risks_mitigation.md  # Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
├── control_measures.md  # KPIs and monitoring guidelines
└── metadata.json        # Contains title, subtitle, and footer information
```

## Setup and Running

1.  **Prerequisites:** A modern web browser.
2.  **Running Locally:**
    *   Navigate to the `SOPMaker` directory.
    *   Start a local HTTP server (e.g., `python -m http.server 3001`).
    *   Open `http://localhost:3001/index.html` in your browser.

## Key Functionality Details

*   **Intelligent SOP Generation (Client-Side):**
    *   Entirely client-side, includes sophisticated process type detection and domain-specific content generation (`generatePlaceholderSopData` in `script.js`).
    *   **Process Detection:** Uses keyword analysis to identify business process types (refund, onboarding, approval, procurement, customer service).
    *   **BPMN Generation:** Creates process-specific BPMN diagrams with appropriate business logic patterns (decision gateways, parallel tasks, approval workflows).
    *   **Content Tailoring:** Generates contextual descriptions, actionable steps, risk assessments, and control measures specific to each process type.
    *   Generated content updates the current view but is **not automatically saved to files**. Users must use the "Save SOP (as ZIP)" feature.
*   **Saving SOPs:**
    *   Uses JSZip to create a ZIP archive in the browser.
    *   The ZIP contains a folder named after the SOP title, which includes `diagram.bpmn`, `description.md`, `procedure_steps.md`, `risks_mitigation.md`, `control_measures.md`, and `metadata.json` (for title, subtitle, footer data).
    *   This is a client-side download; the user manages the downloaded ZIP and its extraction.
*   **Loading SOPs from Folder:**
    *   Uses `<input type="file" webkitdirectory>`. The user selects a folder.
    *   JavaScript reads the expected files (`diagram.bpmn`, `description.md`, `procedure_steps.md`, `risks_mitigation.md`, `control_measures.md`, `metadata.json`) from the selected folder's root.
    *   The page content is updated based on these files, including the new risk assessment and control measures sections.
    *   The application relies on the user selecting a folder that matches the expected structure (typically one created by extracting a previously saved SOP ZIP).
*   **Content Loading (Initial & Markdown):**
    *   The default initial SOP is loaded from `sop_content/`.
    *   Markdown for description is rendered in `<pre>` tags.
    *   Markdown for procedure steps is parsed by a custom JS function into styled HTML.
*   **Styling:** Uses Tailwind CSS and custom styles in `style.css`.
