# 🔄 AI Sync Functionality Explained

## What is "AI: Update Other Sections"?

The SOPMaker application has **three main sections** that work together to create a complete Standard Operating Procedure:

1. **📊 Process Overview (BPMN Diagram)** - Visual workflow diagram
2. **📝 Process Description** - Written explanation of the process  
3. **🛡️ Risk & Control Matrix (RACM)** - Risk management and controls

The **AI Sync buttons** use artificial intelligence to keep these sections **synchronized and consistent** with each other.

## 🎯 How Each Button Works

### 📊 Process Overview → "AI: Update Other Sections"
**What it does:** Analyzes your BPMN diagram and suggests improvements to Description and RACM
**When to use:** After you've modified the BPMN diagram and want other sections to match
**Example:** You add a new approval step to your diagram → AI suggests adding approval controls to RACM

### 📝 Description → "AI: Update Other Sections"  
**What it does:** Analyzes your written description and suggests improvements to BPMN and RACM
**When to use:** After you've updated the process description and want other sections to match
**Example:** You describe a quality check step → AI suggests adding it to the BPMN diagram and RACM matrix

### 🛡️ RACM → "AI: Update Other Sections"
**What it does:** Analyzes your risk matrix and suggests improvements to Description and BPMN
**When to use:** After you've added new risks/controls and want other sections to reflect them
**Example:** You add a data security control → AI suggests updating the description and BPMN to show security steps

## 🔄 The Sync Process

1. **Click Button** → AI analyzes the current section
2. **AI Analysis** → Compares with other sections and identifies improvements
3. **Preview Modal** → Shows exactly what will be changed before applying
4. **Your Choice** → Accept changes or cancel

## 💡 Why This Matters

**Without AI Sync:** You manually update each section separately, risking inconsistencies
**With AI Sync:** All sections stay aligned automatically, ensuring professional, coherent SOPs

## 🎯 Best Practices

- **Start with one section** you're most confident about
- **Use sync buttons** after making significant changes
- **Review suggestions** carefully before accepting
- **Iterate gradually** rather than making massive changes at once

## 🔍 What You'll See in the Preview

The sync preview shows:
- **📊 Process Overview updates** - BPMN diagram suggestions
- **📝 Description enhancements** - Improved text with better clarity
- **🛡️ RACM updates** - New risks, controls, and evidence aligned with your process

Each preview clearly shows what will change, so you're always in control!
